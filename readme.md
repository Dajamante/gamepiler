# Gamepiler

The gamepiler *will* be a tool for checking your errors as achievements.

How it started ^^. At least 150 people liked a tool that would gamify their error as achievements (yay! celebrate errors), and 7 (inclusive meself) needed it very badly. The Gamepiler üçç idea was planted.

Right now it is just counting errors and saving them in a file BUUUUUT there is some hope to turn it into a real cargo tool that will give you stats.

Your error file will be in the `data local dir`, as per [the default paths from the directory crate](https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs).
